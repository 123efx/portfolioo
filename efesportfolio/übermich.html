   My name is Efe Yagiz Dayi. I was born in 2008 in Antalya. Due to family problems, I moved with my mother to Frankfurt, Germany, in 2016. I lived there for 8 years and then moved back to Germany again. Maybe coming back was the best decision of my life because that’s when I got to know programming.

When I started, it was very difficult for me, but I studied with discipline, completed my first project, and then everything fell into place. Today, my friends call me when they have problems with their projects or reach out to me if they need anything. That makes me proud, and I want to continue like this.

I want to learn everything about computer science and programming. It’s not about the future for me — it’s because I enjoy it. It’s all interesting, and when you do things like this and look back at your childhood wondering how programmers do it, you feel proud of yourself.

Every time I start a new project, I get very excited because I think about whether it will go as planned and how it will look. Usually, things don’t go exactly as planned, but I still manage to make it the way I want.
